## Application Architecture
- [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, 
- [redux-saga](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga/) is a library that aims to make side effects (i.e. asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) in React/Redux applications easier and better.
- [redux-persist]() is use to persist and rehydrate a redux store. It is use in this project to persist redux store in react-native `AsyncStorage` and rehydrate on app start.
- [react-navigation](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation) is the official react-native navigation solution. It is extensible yet easy-to-use
- [react-native-localization](https://github.com/stefalda/ReactNativeLocalization) is a library to localize the ReactNative interface
- [react-native-fabric](https://github.com/corymsmith/react-native-fabric) is a React Native library for Fabric, Crashlytics and Answers. It is use in this project for crash reporting.
- [normalizr](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr) normalizes nested JSON according to a schema
- [reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect) is a selector library for Redux that is efficient and can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state.
